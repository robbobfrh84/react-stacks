# Deployment Notes

‚ö†Ô∏èWarning

- When first deploying, make sure you seed any required data within any package.json `postbuild` scripts.
- Here's an example WITH seeds for heroku:
  - $`"heroku-postbuild": "npm run build && npm run seed manifest",`
- ... And, without seeds
  - $`"heroku-postbuild": "npm run build",`

### Heroku (Inital Setup Steps)

From the root level of the **ready-to-deploy**, **updated** master branch

- $`heroku create <name_of_app>`
- Example: $`heroku create kiss-the-sky`

Add mLabs (MongoDB)

- `heroku addons:create mongolab -a <name-of-heroku-app>`
- Example: $`heroku addons:create mongolab -a kiss-the-sky`

### Heroku deploy

For deployment on root level of master branch

- $`git push heroku master`

OR, for deployment on sub-folder of master branch

- $`git subtree push --prefix <your_sub-folder> heroku master`

- Example: `git subtree push --prefix webapp heroku master`üß®

That's it! Should be at live at address they give you as output after (loooong) build process.

Note: modification

### Adding to client's NPM Package

From within `/webapp`
`npm install --prefix ./client some-npm-package`

### MongoDB Notes
- Drop DB
  - $`mongo` returns `>` commandline
    - >`show databases` > shows all local dbs
    - >`use kts`
    - >`db.dropDatabase()`
  - NOTE: you'll have to run `npm run seed manifest` to reset the manifest db, then `npm start`

### Potential issues

Port in use error:
- Example: `[0] Error: listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::3004`
- To kill a port that is stuck in use
  - Run $`lsof -i :3004` (Or whatever port you need).
- This will show a list of services using that port.
- Find the `PID` number associated with the port you want to kill
  - Run $`kill -QUIT PID`
  - Example: $`kill -QUIT 23451` (NOTE: number character length may vary.)
