## Using gh-pages to host a static react app

### And, how to manage a root-page and sub-pages for multiple react apps :)

Overview
- **Setup Journal:** step-by-step guide for deploying to gh-pages from a "from-scratch" react app.
  - The app being hosted can live in whatever folder/sub-folder you prefer. 
  - It's the `"deploy":"<command>"` command AND the `"homepage": "<url>"` value, both within the package.json that tells Github what `<repo>/<sub-page>` url to deploy to. 
    - So you can host multiple react apps, by targeting a different `<repo>/<sub-page>`¬†urls.
    - And, at different page levels too. In this folder you'll see a 'homepage' folder deployed to `<repo>/`, and 'sub-page-example' folder that deploys to a `<repo>/<sub-page>` url.
    - **Important note**: what folder in the repo and what page/subpage they're deployed isn't connected! Note 'homepage' and 'sub-page-example' are at the same folder level, but deployed to different page levels. 

- **Testing build folder locally:** how to test static `build` specific deployments. 
  - You may want to have a static version and a dyanmic version of your webapp. This allows you test write code that makes those two versions behave differently, while sharing the same code base. This section explains how you can test those differences locally.

# Setup journal.  
This example was created from the following this "guide": https://github.com/gitname/react-gh-pages

- **Note:** the following notes may differ from the guide linked above, as I wanted to include subfolders. 

Here are my versions vs. the "guide"'s...
- $`node --version` > v14.16.1 ...guide was v16.13.2
- $`npm --version` > 8.6.0 ...guide was 8.1.2
- $`git --version` > 2.37.1 (Apple Git-137.1 ) ...git version 2.29.1.windows.1

This example will live in the repos sub-folder `gh-pages-static-react`
- So I created that and `cd` into it, then...
- $`npx create-react-app sub-page-example` 
- üëÄ Decided to do the default app rather than the typescript template as the guide did. Just wanted to keep it as simple as possible as a fallback example.

Setup
- $`cd sub-page-example`
- $`npm install gh-pages --save-dev`
- Open `package.json`
- Add a homepage property in this format `https://{username}.github.io/{repo-name}/`
- Or, for **sub-page** format `https://{username}.github.io/{repo-name}/{sub-page-name}/`
  - NOTE: This isn't connected to the actual folder you host the build code. Because the `npm run deploy` command builds it in a different branch.
  ```diff
  {
    "name": "my-app",
    "version": "0.1.0",
  + "homepage": "https://robbobfrh84.github.io/react-stacks/sub-page-example",
    "private": true,
  ```
  
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è For a repo root level page, modify homepage value to: 
    - `"homepage": "https://robbobfrh84.github.io/react-stacks/"`
  
- Add `predeploy` and `deploy` scripts...

  ```diff
    "scripts": {
  +   "predeploy": "npm run build",
  +   "deploy": "gh-pages -d build -e sub-page-example",
      "start": "react-scripts start",
      "build": "react-scripts build",
  ```

  - ‚ö†Ô∏è For a repo root level page, modify deploy value to:
    -  `"deploy": "gh-pages -d build",`

- Check that the app works. $`npm start` ...Maybe change some code?

Deploy the app to github....
- $`npm run deploy`¬† üëÄThis by default added the gh-pages. 

#### REMEMBER
- Pushing changes to `main` branch won't redeploy you must also run...
- $`npm run deploy` to see live changes...

# Testing build folder locally

- Copy `"homepage": "https://robbobfrh84.github.io/react-stacks/",` from package.json
- Save it somewhere reliable. 
  - You CAN note it out, but it's just annoying. 
  - like this `"//": [ "homepage", "https://robbobfrh84.github.io/react-stacks/" ],`
- REMOVE `"homepage": "https://robbobfrh84.github.io/react-stacks/",`
- `npm install -g serve` 
- `serve -s build`
