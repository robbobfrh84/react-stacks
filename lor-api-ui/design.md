# Design

Although this app maintains a level of simplicity, I would like to discuss a few design decisions I implemented to enhance the user experience (UX) and user interface (UI), ensuring both are as intuitive and readable as possible.



### Responsiveness

The primary component of this application that required adaptation for responsive design was the button row. I adjusted it to transform into a single column of stacked buttons when the screen width falls below 600px. Additionally, upon testing the app on my mobile device, I realized the necessity to tweak the padding and margins of both the tables and buttons to optimize space utilization.



### Table Display

In determining the most effective method to present the data, I opted for a reliable table display. However, I introduced an enhancement to readability by implementing alternating gray and white backgrounds. This subtle color variation aids users in accurately tracking and reading data across the table. Furthermore, this structure is scalable, providing a solid foundation for future expansions when additional data is incorporated into the results table.









### UI User Indicators 

A hallmark of excellent design is its ability to provide users with constant, intuitive feedback regarding their interactions within an application. Implementing a simple hover effect not only indicates an interactive element but also enhances user experience by making interactions smooth and enjoyable, which, in turn, fosters user trust. Additionally, incorporating some form of loader is crucial. It reassures users that their actions—such as button clicks—have been registered successfully, and that their requests are being processed.
