Please answer the following questions about your work:

1 - Have you manually tested the solution?

- Yes, both locally and on the live link.

2 - Did you add a test suite? If so, how will we use it? If not, why?

- No. Unfortunately this was not something I was able to have time for.

3 - Did you use any 3rd party library? Why did you use it? What are the tradeoffs?

- Beyond the essential TypeScript and React, I only needed to add the `gh-pages` library to host my web application through my GitHub repository. I prefer to add libraries only when their necessity is thoroughly considered and justified.

4 - Do you feel the UI/UX makes it easy to navigate the data from the API?

- For the simplicity of the app, yes I do feel it works well.

5 - If you had more time, what else would you add?

- I think there were two logical next steps when developing this out.

  - Being able to click on an individual movie, character or quote and trigger another request using the `_id` to get and display more details. 

  - And, adding pagination so that the users could better sift through the data. 

6 - What would you change in your current solution?

- There is some refactoring that needs to be done with the CSS. And, there should be more organization and consideration put into determining which unit system would be most effective to use. 

7 - On a scale of 1 to 10 (10 being the highest), how would you rate this solution?

- How about an 8? Given the time constraints, I must give myself credit for completing everything, at least at the most basic level. Moreover, I learned many things as well!

8 - Anything else we should keep in mind when we evaluate the project?

- I believe that my most prominent qualities as a developer stem from my ability to collaborate and learn from others, as well as from adapting to their insights, flow, style, and ideasâ€”while also contributing my own. Although I enjoyed working on the project and cherish the opportunity to be creative independently, it did not fully leverage what I consider to be one of my greatest strengths.
